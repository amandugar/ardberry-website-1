          'We designed a kinetic façade that gives a sense of moving/ fluttering wings. It is a intelligent structure which gives the face of fluttering wings, and feather in the breeze which breathe throughout the day according to the time, temperature, Sun location and wind direction due to its kinetic and automated structure. The cathedral was a dedication to Mother Mary hence it was more appropriate to come up with a design that boldly spoke the word ‘mother’. The design not only outstands the surrounding scenery but also looks out for whatever is on the inside, just as a mother does for her offspring.',

          'This was an effort to conserve the ancient feeling brought forward by the Notre Dame Cathedral and at the same time give it a modern touch. The Notre Dame Cathedral had a unique work of art that mandates its preservation and since it is the twenty first century it goes without saying that modernisation has to be included too. The old design of the roof had the illusion of enclosing feathers of a mother bird which acted as our basic inspiration. The feeling of protection, security and motherly love was our key inspiration. France is one of the major tourists sites in Europe and he Notre Dame Cathedral has been a popular visiting site for the tourist, having that in mind the proposed design is not a backslide on this factor.',

With the constancy of our design inside and outside we aimed at promoting philosophical openness and psychological freeness. The beat is supposed to establish an unusual vibe of self-consciousness and create that calmness under which one can freshly contemplate on perceptual clarity. Kia motors is a very successful automobile company and keeping that in mind we proposed a design that clearly reflects all their years of success.',

People can gaze at the view from both inside and outside and get the same feeling of relaxation. Customers can wow at the view as positivity just fills the room . Beat 360 is an epitome of creativity linked with its philosophical echo. It engulfs its subjects and submerses them into a thoughtful experience filled with realization. Peace has never been this physical before nor has it been more beautiful. Its general outlook enlightens the blank and arouses the dull. The design is supposed to be more than an inspiration, it is targeted to be a sensation, a promoter of openness.',
